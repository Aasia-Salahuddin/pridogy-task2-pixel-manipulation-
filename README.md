**PIXELMANIPULATION USING XOR**
This Python script demonstrates a straightforward example of applying XOR (exclusive OR) operations 
for image encryption through pixel manipulation. XOR-based encryption is a basic cryptographic technique 
that involves combining the pixel values of an image with an encryption key using the XOR operation. 
While this method is simple, it provides a visual transformation of the image, offering a basic form of 
encryption that is easily reversible..
